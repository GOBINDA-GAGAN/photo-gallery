# React Photo Gallery App

A **simple frontend-only photo gallery** built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
Users can **upload photos** with a **title** and **description**, view them in a gallery, and click on any photo to see its details.

> ⚠️ **Important:** You cannot upload more than ~5MB of image data to localStorage. Exceeding this will cause a `QuotaExceededError`.
